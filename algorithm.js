// Main algorithms we are learning about
// sorting and search algorithms

/*
Algorithms are evaluated based on their computational complexity, or the amount of resources it takes to run them. Those resources include:

Time: The maximum amount of time it would take the algorithm to solve a problem.
Space: The maximum amount of computer memory, or RAM, the algorithm needs to run.

Is it very large or very small?
Very structured or very unstructured?
What types of data does it contain?
