computer science has 3 fields
- theoretical computer science
- computer engineering
- applications

=======================
40 comp sci concepts

1) algorithm and data structures

Big O notation - O(1) O(n) O(n^2) O(2^N) O(log)

sorting algorithms - bubble, sort, merge, etc

data structures - array, stack, queues, hashTable

2) artificial intelligence

greedy algorithm - picks best immediate choice and never reconsider

hill climbing - find better solution by generating neighboring solution

simulated annealing - one chance, sometimes you go back to explore other paths to reduce chances of taking wrong paths

dynamic programming - store results of previous computation for future used

machine learning - finding patterns and giving preferences

P vs NP Problem - easy to solve vs easy to verify AND hard to solve
 
3) computer architecture and engineering

how computers work - car analogy
