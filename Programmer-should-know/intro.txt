40 comp sci concepts

1) algorithm and data structures

Big O notation - O(1) O(n) O(n^2) O(2^N) O(log)

sorting algorithms - bubble, sort, merge, etc

data structures - array, stack, queues, hashTable

2) artificial intelligence

greedy algorithm - picks best immediate choice and never reconsider

hill climbing - find better solution by generating neighboring solution
